          "Tim's been a professional software developer for close to 40 years.
          During his career, he has worked for major companies such as Fujitsu,
          Mitsubishi, and Saab. His video courses are used to train developers
          in major companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Paypal, VW, Pitney Bowes,
          IBM, and T-Mobile just to name a few (via the Udemy for Business
          program). What makes Tim unique is his professional programming career
          - many instructors have never programmed professionally, let alone had
          a distinguished professional development career like Tim. Tim has
          trained over 1.33 million students how to program, way more than a
          typical IT Professor at a college does in a lifetime."
